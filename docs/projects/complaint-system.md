# Complaint Management System

A secure, web-based platform that allows users to seamlessly submit and track 
issues, while providing an administrative dashboard for authorized staff to view, 
filter, update, and effectively resolve these complaints.

* **Backend:** Python3, Flask
* **Database:** MySQL (mysql-connector-python, Flask-Mysqldb)
* **Security:** Flask-WTF, Werkzeug.security, python "secret" module
